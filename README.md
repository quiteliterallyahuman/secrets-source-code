the source code and developer commands for secrets - a game made for the game off 2024


itch page - [quiteliterallyahuman-dev.itch.io/secrets](https://quiteliterallyahuman-dev.itch.io/secrets)

basically its a game about triangles and squares that don't get along. one triangle called frank bumps into a
square and the sqare brags about this secret, something frank has 
not heard of. frank gets angry and kills the square before proceeding to treck to craig, the king square.
frank plans to get the secret off craig and also defeat the squares
once and for all

its a pretty buggy game but still quite fun
